 Personal Profile Website
This is a clean and responsive personal portfolio website built with HTML and CSS. It showcases my skills, projects,
and provides contact links for professional networking.

ðŸ’¼ Purpose
The goal of this project is to create an online presence that reflects my personal brand as a developer, 
designer, or tech enthusiast, and allows visitors to learn more about me and get in touch.
